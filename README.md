I will upload the Jupyter notebooks and neural networks I created while doing my bachelor thesis.

I will use this repository to upload the notebooks I used on my bachelor thesis, where I worked creating machine learning models capable of classifying images containing gestures of the American Sign Language. Apart from that, I will upload all the parts of a process to create a program capable of capable of predicting a message in American Sign Language: the database I created, the Convolutional Neural Network I trained with the database I created (I used artificial extension to amplify the images of the database, but I will just upload the images I colleceted), and the notebooks I used to collect the images and to predict messages.
